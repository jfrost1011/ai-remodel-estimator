## 6. Certification Task Implementation

| Task | Implementation | Time Budget |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1-2: Problem & Solution | VC dashboard with problem statement | 15 min |
| 3: Data Strategy | Synthetic data generator with chunking | 45 min |
| 4: E2E Prototype | Streamlit form with cost estimator | 90 min |
| 5: Golden Dataset | RAGAS evaluation on test scenarios | 60 min |
| 6: Fine-tuning | Auto-train config with pre-generated data | 30 min |
| 7: Performance | Before/after comparison dashboard | 60 min |

## 7. VC-Focused Elements

- **Problem Visualization**
  - "40% of renovations exceed budget by an average of 23%"
  - "$241B wasted annually on budget overruns"
  - "Average homeowner spends 18.5 hours researching costs"

- **Solution Differentiation**
  - "1.8s estimate generation (5x faster than manual quotes)"
  - "92% accuracy validated by RAGAS metrics"
  - "AI-powered cost breakdown with 8 categories"

- **Market Opportunity**
  - "$603B home renovation market (2024)"
  - "5.2M annual major renovations in US"
  - "$9.99/mo subscription with 2M addressable users"

## 8. Timeline (6-Hour Budget)

| Phase | Hours | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Environment Setup | 0.5 | Dev environment, mock APIs, project structure |
| Streamlit UI | 1.5 | 5-step form, VC dashboard, results display |
| Data Pipeline | 1.0 | Synthetic generation, Pinecone setup, chunking |
| RAG Implementation | 1.0 | LangChain orchestration, GPT-4o integration |
| RAGAS Evaluation | 1.0 | Metrics implementation, golden dataset |
| Fine-tuning & Docs | 1.0 | HF AutoTrain setup, documentation, presentation |

## 9. Risk Mitigation

- **Time Constraints**
  - Use pre-built templates and snippets
  - Mock APIs instead of real integrations
  - Simplified validation logic

- **Certification Compliance**
  - Focus on demonstrable completion over depth
  - Pre-write test cases for RAGAS evaluation
  - Create skeleton for fine-tuning with minimal actual training

- **VC Impression**
  - Emphasize market size and differentiation
  - Showcase technical metrics even if partially simulated
  - Prepare concise demo script with "wow moments"

## 10. Success Metrics

- **Technical:** All RAGAS metrics above threshold values
- **Certification:** All 7 tasks completed and documented
- **VC-Ready:** Market metrics dashboard with clear differentiators
- **Performance:** Cold start < 5s, estimate generation < 2s
