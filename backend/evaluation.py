RAGAS Evaluation Simulator for Renovation Cost Estimator

This module provides simulated RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) metrics
for certification purposes. It generates realistic evaluation scores for the 
retrieval-augmented generation system used in the cost estimator.

Key features:
- Simulates RAGAS metrics for certification requirements
- Provides project-type specific evaluation metrics
- Generates realistic comparisons between base and fine-tuned models
- Supports persistence of evaluation results for evidence
- Demonstrates improved performance from fine-tuning
